# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my portfolio website, designed and developed with simplicity and efficiency in mind. The site serves as a straightforward showcase of my skills, projects, and background, built using only the most essential web technologies.

## Live Version

The live version is available at [grzegorzmalisz.com](https://grzegorzmalisz.com).

## Overview

The website is crafted to be lightweight, fast, and user-friendly. By using fundamental web technologies without complex frameworks or libraries, it remains accessible, easy to maintain, and quick to load on any device.

- **Minimalist Design**: Clean and intuitive layout that highlights content without unnecessary embellishments.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimised for viewing on all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Basic Web Technologies**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no heavy frameworks, libraries, or dependencies.

## Technologies Used
